This is a simple command line database that implements a hash system of storage, like Redis. It does not meet the qualifications of persistence as it disappears as soon as the program is done. To start the database on your terminal, simply type "ruby FILENAME", where filename is a stand-in for the command-line-database.rb file, wherever it exists on your system. This database uses STDIN/STDOUT and to run test data from a file, you can type "ruby FILENAME < TESTFILE". End of file triggers closing the database.
